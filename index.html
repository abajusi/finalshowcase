                    <p class="pre-wrap lead">I’m from the southtowns of Buffalo NY, where I grew up ski racing, raising chickens, and making maple syrup. Although I’m working as business analyst this summer, I am currently pursuing a double major in computer science and cognitive science. Specifially, I have been concentrating in data, databases, and artificial intelligence over the course of my education. I will be graduating from Case Western Reserve University in the spring of 2023 with a B.S. degree. </p>

To take advantage of the deal, users just need to scan their receipt as proof of their purchase. When they do, all the data from their purchase gets ingested by Fetch and then sent over to us here at Smucker!</p>

                                    <p style="text-align:left;" class="mb-5">Fetch sends us all this information every day in 7 different files. As a result, the requirements for ingesting this data on our end were pretty extensive. One of my first projects was gathering information on the when, where, and how the data was being delivered, and then using that info to write that section of the requirements. </p>
                                    <p style="text-align:left;" class="mb-5">Besides the number of files, the other challenge with this project was the number of purchase data categories that we had access to. Due to some privacy laws, users have the right to know what data businesses are storing about them, as well as the right to have them delete that data upon request. In an effort to avoid making users uncomfortable by needlessly storing sensitive personal data, I went through the potential data categories and noted the ones that we would not want to ingest. I was then able to communicate with the Fetch team to determine an elimination method that would work on both our ends. </p>

Participating dogs and their owners will receive a box of Milk-Bone goodies, as well as the option to sign up for the Milk-Bone email list.

It got a little bit complicated because the time frame was very limited, and the Browns declined to use our preferred method of sending over the user data. This gave me some pretty significant experience with asking the important questions, as well as learning about how different interactions with our business partners and 3rd parties can vary in ease of comunication.  </p>

Although The estimated growth is small, this is the first initiative that starts to accumulate net new consumers for Pet outside of signups through the JMS website.

Everything with the recall was happening so fast and in such a huge volume of consumers that these requests were being tracked in an excel spreadsheet. This was not efficient or sustainable, so consumer relations asked IS to build a custom application to keep track of it all. The assembled team contained members from a variety of verticals and roles who came together to support the business during the recall.  </p>

                                    <p style="text-align:left;" class="mb-5">ADDAPT stands for Allies, Disabilities, and Diverse Abilities Partnering Together. It is meant to serve as an employee resource group that will provide support for disabled employees and caregivers to people with disabilities. The group aims to make the Smucker campus and culture more accessible to all by making physical changes and driving awareness of disability presentation in the workplace.   </p>
                                    <p class="mb-5"><b>What did I do?</b></p>
                                    <p style="text-align:left;" class="mb-5">I first found out about ADDAPT through a presentation about the various ERGs that Smucker sponsors. As a disabled employee myself, I could tell that there was not any disability representation among the founding members of the group just based on the language that was used to describe the ERG. ADDAPT hadn’t launched yet, so I was able to lend them a disabled perspective as they made some significant edits to their charter. </p>
                                    <p class="mb-5"><b>What was the result?</b></p>
                                    <p style="text-align:left;" class="mb-5">This was an incredibly positive experience for me as a disabled employee. The charter is inclusive and contains a great initial plan of action and accountability. The group will be having its launch this October, and I’m personally very excited to see what they come up with so check it out!</p>

                                    <p style="text-align:left;" class="mb-5">Dare to Lead is a book by Brenee Brown that explores how to be a daring leader by bringing your entire self into the workplace. The book club follows her workbook, leading participants in an examination of their team and their own workplace habits. Each week, we would read a certain number of pages and then meet to discuss what we’d read as a group. The intern edition of the book club features groups of all interns, as well as a few full-time employees as facilitators. </p>
                                    <p class="mb-5"><b>Feedback:</b></p>
                                    <p style="text-align:left;" class="mb-5">Being a part of the IS book club was an interesting and something experience. However, I think that some of the sections and material were definitely more applicable than others. A lot of the workbook activities were heavily centered around examining the practices and success of your team, and we had only been with a team for a short period of time at that point. I would recommend that the book club be focused around select chapters if interns continue to be included in the future. That way, interns get the most out of the Dare to Lead Experience and are able to have productive conversation in the book club meetings.     </p>
